CSS to Asset Pipeline Converter


### WAT?

Css2AP aims to be simple app, that helps convert normal CSS file, that graphic designer tends to create, into SCSS file, that is fully (eghem…) compatible with Asset Pipeline (Rails guys will know). By compatible I mean that beside converting CSS to SCSS it also converts ```url('')``` paths into ```image-url``` function, understendable by Asset Pipeline.

Demo here: http://css2ap.prograils.com

App was created (well… rewritten from Rails) for fun in [Happy](https://github.com/hmans/happy/) framework.

#### Inspiration
I was **higly** inspired by existing [css2sass](http://css2sass.heroku.com/) converter.
