CSS to Asset Pipeline Converter

## WAT?

This aims to be simple app, that helps me convert normal CSS file, that my graphic designer tends to create, into SCSS file, that is fully (eghem…) compatible with Asset Pipeline (Rails guys will know). By compatible I mean that beside converting CSS to SCSS it also converts ```url('')``` paths into ```image-url``` function, understendable by Asset Pipeline.

App was created (well… rewritten from Rails) for fun in [Happy](https://github.com/hmans/happy/) framework.

#### Inspiration
I was **higly** inspired by existing [css2sass](http://css2sass.heroku.com/) converter.
